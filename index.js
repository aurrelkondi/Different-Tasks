// 1. If your country split in half,and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?

// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people.Does your country
// have less people than the average country?
// 5. Based on the variables you created,create a new variable'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'

/* Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMI susing the formula(you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable'markHigherBMI'containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
