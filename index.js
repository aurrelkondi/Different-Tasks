// 1. Declarevariablescalled'country','continent'and'population'and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
// 2. Logtheirvaluestotheconsole

// 2) Data Types
// 1. Declareavariablecalled'isIsland'andsetitsvalueaccordingtoyour country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 2. Logthetypesof'isIsland','population','country'and'language' to the console

// let, const and var
// 1. Set the value of'language'to the language spoken where youlive(some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables(which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now,and observe what happens

// Basic Operators

// 1. If your country split in half,and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?
// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million.Does your country have more people than Finland?
// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people.Does your country
// have less people than the average country?
// 5. Based on the variables you created,create a new variable'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'

/* Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMI susing the formula(you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable'markHigherBMI'containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ */
